## Sort Three Numbers Using Conditional Statements

This program sorts three given integers in ascending order using only conditional statements. It demonstrates an alternative approach to sorting without relying on Python's list sorting functions or methods.

### How It Works

The program receives three integer inputs and sorts them in ascending order through a series of conditional statements. It determines the correct order by comparing the integers and then prints them from smallest to largest.

### Input

Users are prompted to input three integers, one after the other.

### Output

The program prints the three integers in ascending order, separated by spaces.

### Example

```
$ python main.py
3
1
2
1 2 3
$ python main.py
5
3
4
3 4 5
$ python main.py
10
20
15
10 15 20
$ python main.py
8
7
9
7 8 9
```
