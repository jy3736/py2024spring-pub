## Single Even Integer

This program determines if exactly one out of two given integers is even. It's designed for use cases where identifying a single even number among two is important.

### How It Works

The program takes two integer inputs and checks if only one of them is even. It outputs "YES" if only one of the integers is even, and "NO" if both or neither are even.

### Input

Users are expected to input two integers, one after the other.

### Output

The output will be "YES" if exactly one of the provided integers is even, and "NO" otherwise.

### Example

```
$ python main.py
4
5
YES
$ python main.py
2
6
NO
$ python main.py
7
9
NO
$ python main.py
3
10
YES
```
