## Chocolate Bar Splitting Problem

Write a program to determine if a rectangular chocolate bar can be split into two parts, with one part containing exactly `k` squares.

### Input:

- Three integers, `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the dimensions of the chocolate bar (`n` by `m`) and the desired number of squares (`k`) in one part after the split.

### Output:

- Print "YES" if the chocolate bar can be split accordingly, and "NO" otherwise. Ensure the output is in uppercase.

### Python Solution: `main.py`

```python
def can_split_chocolate(n, m, k):
    # replace pass with your code
    pass
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, m, k = map(int, input("Enter n, m, k: ").split())
    print(can_split_chocolate(n, m, k))
```
