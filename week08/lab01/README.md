## Leap Year Determination

rite a program to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. Print "LEAP" if the year is a leap year, and "COMMON" otherwise, ensuring the output is in uppercase.

### Criteria for a Leap Year (Gregorian Calendar):

1. A year is considered a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100.
2. A year is also a leap year if it is divisible by 400.

**Output Requirement:** The program should output "LEAP" for leap years and "COMMON" for non-leap years, with both words in uppercase.

### Sample Solution: `main.py`

```python
def is_leap_year(year):
    # replace pass with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
    print(is_leap_year(year))
```
