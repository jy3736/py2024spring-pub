## Find the Index of the Outlier

Write a program to identify the index of the unique integer among three given integers, where two integers are equal and one is different.

**Input:**

- Three integers, among which two are identical and one is different.

**Output:**

- Print the index (1, 2, or 3) of the unique integer.

### Python Solution: `main.py`

```python
def find_outlier_index(a, b, c):
    # replace pass with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    a, b, c = map(int, input("Enter three integers: ").split())
    print(find_outlier_index(a, b, c))
```
