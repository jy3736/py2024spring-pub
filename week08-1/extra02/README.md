## Finding the Second Largest Number

Write a program that identifies the second largest number within a unique sequence of positive integers. The sequence terminates with a 0, signaling the end of input. You are guaranteed that the sequence contains at least two distinct elements. The goal is to determine and return the value of the second largest element in the given sequence.

### Python Solution (`main.py`)

```python
def find_second_largest(sequence):
    # replace pass with your code
    pass
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sequence = [int(input()) for _ in range(int(input("Enter number of elements followed by the elements (end with 0):\\n")))]
    print(f"The second largest number is: {find_second_largest(sequence)}")
```
