## Swapping Adjacent Elements in a List

Create a function that takes a list of integers as input. The function should iterate through the list and swap each pair of adjacent elements. If the list contains an odd number of elements, the last element should remain unchanged. The function then returns the modified list.

### Python Solution (`main.py`)

```python
def swap_adjacent(lst):
    # replace pass with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(swap_adjacent([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
    print(swap_adjacent([10, 20, 30, 40]))
```
