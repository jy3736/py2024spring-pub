## Number of primes in range

Write a program to calculate the count of prime numbers within a specified range. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1, which has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. The program should accept two integers, A and B, and return the total number of prime numbers that lie between A and B, inclusive.

### Python Solution (`main.py`)

```python
def count_primes(A, B):
    # replace pass with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Basic self-test examples
    print(count_primes(1, 10))  # Expected: 4 (2, 3, 5, 7)
    print(count_primes(11, 19)) # Expected: 4 (11, 13, 17, 19)
```
