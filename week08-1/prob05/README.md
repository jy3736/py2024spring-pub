## Capitalize Inner 'h's

Given a string, your task is to replace every occurrence of the letter 'h' with an uppercase 'H', except for the first and the last occurrences. This transformation should apply regardless of the initial case of the 'h's found within the string.

### Python Solution (`main.py`)

```python
def capitalize_inner_hs(s):
    # replace pass with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(capitalize_inner_hs("hello, how are you hoping to handle this?"))
```
