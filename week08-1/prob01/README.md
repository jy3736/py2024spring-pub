### Is Prime

Write a function to determine whether a given natural number greater than 1 is prime. A prime number is defined as a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. For an input integer (N > 1), the function should return 'PRIME' if (N) is a prime number, and 'COMPOSITE' otherwise.

Python Solution (`main.py`)

```python
def is_prime(n):
    # replace pass with your implementation
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    print(is_prime(n))
```
