### **Maximum Element in a List**

**Problem Statement:** Write a program to find the maximum element in a given list of numbers. Do not use the built-in `max()` function.

**Input/Output Spec:** The program takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the maximum number.

### **Sample Solution:**

```python
def find_maximum(numbers):
    # replace pass statement with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(find_maximum(numbers))
```

**Explanation:** This program defines a function `find_maximum` that iterates through each number in a given list to find the maximum value. It initializes the maximum number as the first element and updates it whenever a larger number is found.
