### **Duplicate Elements Removal**

**Problem Statement:** Write a program that removes all duplicate elements from a given list of integers.

**Input/Output Spec:** The program takes a list of integers as input and outputs a new list with all duplicates removed.

### **Sample Solution:**

```python
def remove_duplicates(numbers):
    # replace pass statement with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(remove_duplicates(numbers))
```

**Explanation:** This program defines a function `remove_duplicates` that creates a new list and adds numbers to it only if they are not already present, effectively removing duplicates.
