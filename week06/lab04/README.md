### **Find the Sum of Odd Numbers**

**Problem Statement:** Write a program to calculate the sum of all odd numbers in a given list of integers.

**Input/Output Spec:** The program takes a list of integers as input and outputs the sum of all odd numbers.

### **Sample Solution:**

```python
def sum_of_odd(numbers):
    # replace pass statement with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(sum_of_odd(numbers))
```

**Explanation:** This program defines a function `sum_of_odd` that iterates through each number in the list and adds it to a sum if it is odd, then returns the sum of all odd numbers.
