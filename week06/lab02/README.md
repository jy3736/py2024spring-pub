### **Count Even Numbers**

**Problem Statement:** Write a program that counts how many even numbers are in a given list of integers.

**Input/Output Spec:** The program takes a list of integers as input and outputs the count of even numbers.

### **Sample Solution:**

```python
def count_even(numbers):
    # replace pass statement with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(count_even(numbers))
```

**Explanation:** This program defines a function `count_even` that iterates over the list and increments a counter every time it encounters an even number. It returns the count of even numbers in the list.
