### **Reverse a List**

**Problem Statement:** Write a program to reverse a given list of numbers. Do not use the built-in `reverse()` or `[::-1]` methods.

**Input/Output Spec:** The program takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the list in reverse order.

### **Sample Solution:**

```python
def reverse_list(numbers):
    # replace pass statement with your code
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(reverse_list(numbers))
```

**Explanation:** This program defines a function `reverse_list` that creates a new list and appends each number from the original list in reverse order, effectively reversing the list without using built-in methods.
