## Numbers in Ascending Order

This program checks if three given integers are in ascending order. It's designed for scenarios where verifying the sequential order of numbers is required.

### How It Works

Upon receiving three integer inputs, the program determines if they are provided in ascending order (i.e., each number is smaller than the next). It outputs "YES" if the integers are in ascending order, and "NO" if they are not.

### Input

Users should input three different integers, one after the other.

### Output

The program outputs "YES" if the provided integers are in ascending order, and "NO" otherwise.

### Example

```
$ python main.py
1
2
3
YES
$ python main.py
4
3
5
NO
$ python main.py
10
20
30
YES
$ python main.py
9
8
7
NO
```
