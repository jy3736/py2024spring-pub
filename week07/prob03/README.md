### String Compression

Develop a Python program that compresses a string by replacing sequences of repeated characters with the character followed by the count of the repetition. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3". If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your program should return the original string. The program should be case-sensitive, treating 'a' and 'A' as distinct characters.

**Input Requirements:**

- A single string, `s`, consisting of alphanumeric characters.

**Output Requirements:**

- The compressed string if it is shorter than the original; otherwise, the original string.

**Sample Solution:**

```python
def compress_string(s):
    # replace pass with your solution
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    input_string = input("Enter the string to compress: ")
    print(compress_string(input_string))
```
