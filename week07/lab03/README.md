### Duplicate Character Removal

**Description:**

Write a Python program that removes all duplicate characters from a given string and returns a string where each character appears only once. The characters should appear in the order of their first occurrence in the input string.

- **Input Description:** A single line string `input_string` representing the input text, which may contain duplicates of characters.
- **Output Description:** A single string with all duplicate characters removed, preserving the order of their first appearance.

### Sample Solution:

```python
def remove_duplicates(input_string):
    # replace pass with your solution
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_text = input("Enter a string: ")
    no_duplicates = remove_duplicates(input_text)
    print(f"String after removing duplicates: {no_duplicates}")

```
