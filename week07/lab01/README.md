### Word Reversal in a Sentence

**Description:**

Write a Python program that takes a sentence as input and reverses the order of the words in the sentence. The sentence will only contain words separated by spaces; there will be no punctuation or special characters. The program should maintain the original spacing between words.

- **Input Description:** A single line string `sentence` representing the input sentence.
- **Output Description:** A single line string containing the words from the input sentence in reverse order, maintaining the original spacing between words.

### Sample Solution:

```python
def reverse_sentence(sentence):
    # replace pass with your solution
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")
    output_sentence = reverse_sentence(input_sentence)
    print(output_sentence)
```
