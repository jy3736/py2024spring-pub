### Find the Longest Word

**Description:**

Write a Python program that takes a string consisting of multiple words separated by spaces and finds the longest word in the string. If there are multiple words of the same maximum length, the program should return the first one that appears in the string.

- **Input Description:** A single line string `text` representing the input text, containing multiple words separated by spaces.
- **Output Description:** A single string which is the longest word found in the input text. If multiple words share the maximum length, return the first one.

### Sample Solution:

```python
def find_longest_word(text):
    # replace pass with your solution
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_text = input("Enter a text: ")
    longest_word = find_longest_word(input_text)
    print(f"The longest word is: {longest_word}")
```
