## Distance to Closest Point

This program calculates the distance from a given point A to the nearest point among two other points, B and C, on a line. It is intended for situations where finding the shortest distance to a point is necessary.

### How It Works

The program takes the coordinates of three points on a line as input. It calculates the distances from point A to points B and C, then identifies the shortest of these two distances. This closest distance is then output.

### Input

Users must input the coordinates of points A, B, and C as integers, one after the other.

### Output

The program outputs the distance from point A to the closest point (either B or C).

### Example

```shell
$ python main.py
1
5
3
2
$ python main.py
2
8
4
2
$ python main.py
6
