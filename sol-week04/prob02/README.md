## Divisible by Four

This program checks if a given integer is divisible by 4 without any remainder. It's useful for situations where determining divisibility by 4 is required.

### How It Works

Upon receiving an integer input, the program evaluates if it is divisible by 4. It outputs "YES" if the integer is divisible by 4 with no remainder, and "NO" otherwise.

### Input

The user is expected to input an integer.

### Output

The program prints "YES" if the provided integer is divisible by 4, and "NO" if it is not.

### Example

```
$ python main.py
8
YES
$ python main.py
5
NO
$ python main.py
16
YES
$ python main.py
22
